This is a collection of scripts and modules to do various
accounting and billing stuff on the OSDC infrastructure using
python.

NovaUserReporting - It queries nova db and uses PollGluster to
    generate user usage statistics and email them as a csv.
    IT also is used to push to our Salesforce.com based invoice
    system.

PollGluster - It is a poller that basically parses
    gluster volume USER-HOME into a table, then queries it
    when needed.  Superseceded by repquota.py

RepQuota - This polls an xnetid script that reports the 
    filesystem quotas.  Allows us to track people outside
    of gluster limited path based quota reporting.

UnitConversion - Found it on StackExchange, its useful for
    converting disk units.

SalesforceOCC -  Module built around Beatbox to allow us 
    to generate info about users in Salesforce and push
    invoicing.   Work in progress.


cloud_report.py - Main command to generate usage/billing reports
